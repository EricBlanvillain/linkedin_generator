Version: 1.0
Date: April 7, 2025
Author: Eric
Status: Draft

1. Introduction / Overview

This document outlines the requirements for the "LinkedIn Style Syncer & Post Generator" (Project Name TBC), a web application designed to help users create new LinkedIn posts that authentically match their unique, established writing style. Users will input samples of their previous LinkedIn posts, which will be analyzed by an AI model (Anthropic Claude) to define a distinct personal "style." Users can save multiple named styles and then generate new post drafts based on selected styles and provided topic inputs.

2. Goals

User Goal: Enable users to quickly generate high-quality, on-brand LinkedIn posts that maintain their personal voice and style consistency, saving time and effort.

User Goal: Help users overcome writer's block when creating LinkedIn content.

Business Goal: Create a valuable tool for professionals, marketers, and content creators active on LinkedIn.

Business Goal: Establish a foundation for potential future premium features or integrations.

Technical Goal: Successfully integrate the Anthropic API for sophisticated style analysis and content generation.

3. Target Audience

Primary: Professionals, thought leaders, consultants, coaches, and small business owners who regularly post on LinkedIn and want to maintain a consistent personal brand voice.

Secondary: Social media managers, marketing agencies, content creators managing multiple client accounts or their own brand.

Tertiary: Job seekers aiming to establish a professional online presence.

4. Key Features

4.1. User Authentication & Profile
* REQ-AUTH-001: Users must be able to sign up and log in to the application (e.g., using email/password, potentially Google/LinkedIn OAuth in future versions).
* REQ-AUTH-002: User accounts are required to save and manage personal styles.

4.2. Style Ingestion & Analysis
* REQ-STYLE-001: Provide a user interface (e.g., a large text area) for users to paste the text content of multiple (e.g., 3-10 suggested) of their existing LinkedIn posts.
* REQ-STYLE-002: On user submission, send the provided post texts to the Anthropic API.
* REQ-STYLE-003: Utilize a carefully crafted prompt for the Anthropic API to analyze the texts and extract key stylistic elements. The analysis should identify (at minimum):
* Overall Tone (e.g., Formal, Informal, Enthusiastic, Analytical, Inspirational, Humorous)
* Key Themes/Topics frequently discussed
* Common Keywords & Phrasing
* Typical Sentence Structure & Length (e.g., short & punchy, complex sentences)
* Use of Emojis (frequency, type)
* Common Call-to-Actions (if any)
* Perspective (e.g., First-person, Third-person)
* REQ-STYLE-004 (Optional V1 / Recommended V1.1): Display a summary of the analyzed style characteristics to the user for review/confirmation before saving.

4.3. Style Saving & Management
* REQ-SAVE-001: Allow users to provide a custom, user-friendly name for the analyzed style (e.g., "Eric's Professional Tone", "My Thought Leader Voice").
* REQ-SAVE-002: Store the analyzed style profile (the output from REQ-STYLE-003, potentially alongside the original input posts for reference/retraining) associated with the user's account and the custom name.
* REQ-SAVE-003: Provide a dashboard or list view where users can see all their saved styles.
* REQ-SAVE-004: Allow users to delete saved styles.
* REQ-SAVE-005 (Future): Allow users to edit the name of a saved style.
* REQ-SAVE-006 (Future): Allow users to potentially refine or update a style by adding more posts later.

4.4. Post Generation
* REQ-GEN-001: Provide a user interface for generating a new post.
* REQ-GEN-002: Users must select one of their previously saved styles to use for generation.
* REQ-GEN-003: Provide input fields for the user to guide the post generation, such as:
* Topic / Title (Required)
* Key Talking Points / Elements (e.g., bullet points, short sentences) (Required)
* Keywords to include (Optional)
* Desired Call-to-Action (Optional)
* Target Audience (Optional, helps refine tone/language)
* REQ-GEN-004: On user submission, send the selected style profile details and the user's input elements to the Anthropic API.
* REQ-GEN-005: Utilize a carefully crafted prompt for the Anthropic API instructing it to generate a LinkedIn post draft based specifically on the provided style profile and input elements.
* REQ-GEN-006: Display the generated LinkedIn post draft(s) to the user (consider generating 1-3 variations).
* REQ-GEN-007: Allow users to easily copy the generated post text to their clipboard.
* REQ-GEN-008: Provide a simple text editor or allow users to easily edit the generated post within the application before copying.

5. User Flow / Use Cases

Use Case 1: Creating a New Style

User logs in/signs up.

User navigates to the "Create New Style" section.

User pastes several of their existing LinkedIn posts into the input area.

User clicks "Analyze Style".

System sends data to Anthropic API and receives analysis. (Optional: Display analysis summary).

User is prompted to name the style.

User enters a name (e.g., "Eric Professional Linkedin Style") and clicks "Save Style".

System confirms the style is saved and adds it to the user's list of styles.

Use Case 2: Generating a New Post

User logs in.

User navigates to the "Generate Post" section.

User selects a saved style from a dropdown/list (e.g., "Eric Professional Linkedin Style").

User fills in the input fields: Topic ("Announcing new product feature"), Key Points ("- Easier reporting\n- Saves time\n- Beta available now"), CTA ("Link in comments to sign up for beta").

User clicks "Generate Post".

System sends style info and input elements to Anthropic API.

System displays the generated LinkedIn post draft(s).

User reviews the draft(s), potentially edits one in-app.

User clicks "Copy Post" for the desired draft.

User pastes the content into LinkedIn.

Use Case 3: Managing Styles

User logs in.

User navigates to the "My Styles" dashboard.

User sees a list of their saved styles ("Eric Professional Linkedin Style", "Casual Friday Thoughts").

User clicks a "Delete" icon next to a style they no longer need.

System prompts for confirmation.

User confirms, and the style is removed.

6. Design & UX Considerations

Clean, professional, and intuitive user interface.

Clear instructions and feedback throughout the process (e.g., loading indicators during API calls).

Easy copy-paste functionality for both inputting posts and outputting generated content.

Mobile responsiveness for accessibility on different devices.

Error handling (e.g., API errors, insufficient input posts).

7. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: API calls to Anthropic may take time. Provide user feedback (loading states). Aim for analysis/generation within 10-20 seconds ideally.

Scalability: The application should handle a moderate number of concurrent users. Consider API rate limits and costs.

Security: Protect user credentials and stored style data. Securely manage Anthropic API keys.

Reliability: Ensure high availability, especially for the core generation feature. Implement robust error handling for API interactions.

Maintainability: Write clean, well-documented code.

8. Technology Stack (Proposed)

Frontend: React / Vue / Svelte / Angular (TBD)

Backend: Node.js / Python (Flask/Django) (TBD)

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB (TBD) - Needed for user accounts and saved styles.

AI Model: Anthropic Claude API

9. Success Metrics

Number of registered users.

Number of styles created per user (average).

Number of posts generated per user (average).

User retention rate (e.g., % users returning after 1 week/1 month).

Qualitative user feedback (surveys, interviews).

Task completion rate (e.g., % users successfully generating a post after creating a style).

10. Future Considerations / Out of Scope for V1

Direct LinkedIn integration (OAuth) for posting.

Importing posts via LinkedIn URL.

Uploading post history files.

Advanced style editing/refinement capabilities.

Team/Collaboration features.

A/B testing different LLM prompts for better results.

Support for other platforms (e.g., Twitter/X).

Analytics on generated post-performance (requires integration).

Free/Premium tier structure.

11. Open Questions

What is the optimal number of input posts required for a reliable style analysis?

How exactly should the "style profile" derived from the analysis be structured and stored? (e.g., JSON object with key-value pairs for tone, keywords, etc.)

What are the precise prompts to be used for the Anthropic API for analysis and generation? (Requires iteration).

What are the cost implications of Anthropic API usage per user/per action?

Specific error handling strategies for API timeouts or invalid responses.
